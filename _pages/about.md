I am a PH.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yongfeng Huang](http://thungnlab.cn/).

<!-- I am passionate about designing text mining algorithm for real-world application, including recommendation, medical NLP and NLP for social good.
As such, I work at the intersection of data mining and natural language processing. -->
<!-- 
Currently, I am working on topic-based summarization with minimal supervision, a novel task for large corpus summarization, advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). -->
